# DECISIONS

_Significant engineering decisions and their rationale. Append new ones at the bottom; never silently reverse one without a new entry explaining why._
_Last updated: 2026-08-17._

Format per entry: **Problem → Decision → Reasoning → Alternatives → Tradeoffs → Future.**

`D1–D18` were made during the initial planning session (2026-08-17), before any code existed.

---

## D1. Full system and hackathon demo are two separate projects
- **Problem:** Demo pressure corrupts architecture — shortcuts taken to fit a stage become permanent.
- **Decision:** `FullProject/` designs and builds the real system. `DemoProject/` is a separate repo
  with separate docs that *selects a slice* of it. Design decisions live here; demo-only shortcuts
  live there and must name the full-system piece they stand in for.
- **Reasoning:** The judging criteria include **Feasibility** — being able to show "here's the demo,
  here's the real architecture behind it" is worth more than a demo alone.
- **Tradeoffs:** Some duplicated setup; two git histories to keep tidy.
- **Future:** Demo code that turns out to be genuinely good gets promoted *upward* with a decision entry.

## D2. Modular monolith with multiple entrypoints, not microservices
- **Problem:** The system has genuinely separate runtime concerns (HTTP API, event consumers,
  real-time audio, GPU inference) but a team of five and a hackathon timeline.
- **Decision:** One codebase, one dependency set, several process entrypoints
  (`entrypoints/api.py`, `worker.py`, `media.py`, `stt.py`) sharing `domain` + `ports`.
- **Reasoning:** The hard boundaries that matter (ports/adapters, service modules) are enforced by
  module structure, not by network hops. GPU and audio processes get their own lifecycle without
  paying for distributed tracing, service discovery, and N deploy pipelines.
- **Alternatives:** True microservices — rejected as premature; a single process — rejected because
  GPU inference and async audio must not share an event loop with the API.
- **Tradeoffs:** Shared deps mean the STT worker installs the web stack too.
- **Future:** Any module can be lifted out at a port boundary later; the event bus is already there.

## D3. Ports & adapters for every external dependency
- **Problem:** Telephony, STT, LLM, and *especially the bank's data* are all unknown or likely to
  change — the last one changes on the morning of the hackathon.
- **Decision:** A `Protocol` per external concern in `ports/`; implementations in `adapters/`;
  selection by env var. Business logic never imports a vendor SDK. Every port ships a real, a fake,
  and a null adapter, and a **contract test suite** all adapters must pass.
- **Reasoning:** This is the single highest-leverage structural choice for this competition: it turns
  "the data isn't what we assumed" from a rewrite into a config change.
- **Tradeoffs:** More indirection; a little boilerplate per adapter.
- **Future:** Any real bank system (Genesys, a policy admin API, an on-prem LLM) plugs in the same way.

## D4. Identity is bound server-side at intent creation, never asserted by the client
- **Problem:** The whole value proposition is "the agent already knows who this is". Getting that
  wrong is a security incident, not a UX bug.
- **Decision:** `POST /v1/calls/intents` derives `customer_id` from the authenticated app session. The
  response carries an opaque, short-lived `correlation_token` that the call must present.
- **Reasoning:** Phone numbers are spoofable and shared; app sessions are not. WebRTC carries the
  token in signalling, so identity is cryptographically bound to the media session.
- **Alternatives:** ANI-only identification — kept strictly as the degraded PSTN fallback (ANI +
  pending-intent window + IVR code), never as the primary.
- **Tradeoffs:** Non-app callers get a weaker path. Accepted — they're outside the pitched journey.

## D5. The bank's data is READ-ONLY; everything we produce goes in our own store
- **Problem:** A hackathon will hand us an extract or a read endpoint, not write access to core systems.
  The pitch also promises we *don't change the core insurance system*.
- **Decision:** Two stores. `core` is behind `CoreDataProvider` with a `SELECT`-only DB role.
  Everything ReadyCall generates (transcripts, briefs, routing decisions, wrap-ups) lands in `readycall`
  and is joined by key at read time.
- **Reasoning:** Matches reality and the pitch's own feasibility claim ("an AI context layer on top of
  existing workflows"). Also means we can never corrupt their data.
- **Tradeoffs:** "Recent context" is assembled from two places at read time.
- **Future:** If write-back is ever permitted, it's an outbound port — not a schema change.

## D6. Context assembly starts at *tap*, not at *answer*
- **Problem:** If context loads when the agent picks up, we've saved nothing.
- **Decision:** `intent.created` immediately triggers an async `ContextAssembler.build(...)`, frozen
  into a `context_snapshots` row with per-field provenance and freshness.
- **Reasoning:** The non-speech half of the brief is then ready before the phone even rings; the
  latency budget for the visible path collapses to "push a prepared object".
- **Tradeoffs:** Work done for calls that never connect (mitigated: intents expire, snapshots are cheap).
- **Future:** Prefetch could start on *plan view* rather than *tap* — measure abandonment first.

## D7. Briefs are versioned and immutable, never mutated in place
- **Problem:** The brief changes as speech arrives; agents and auditors need to know what was known when.
- **Decision:** Each analysis pass writes a new `case_briefs` row (`v1` context-only, `v2…` speech-informed,
  final flagged). The screen renders the latest; history is retained.
- **Reasoning:** Makes "how early did we get it right?" measurable, and makes demos reproducible.
- **Tradeoffs:** More rows. Trivial at this scale.

## D8. Routing is deterministic and explainable; the LLM only labels intent
- **Problem:** Which human gets which customer is an auditable, regulated decision. The brief
  explicitly forbids decisioning that could become discriminatory.
- **Decision:** A weighted deterministic scorer over skills, availability, continuity, priority,
  fitness and fairness. The LLM contributes only the *intent label + confidence*. Every candidate's
  full score breakdown is persisted in `routing_decisions`.
- **Reasoning:** Explainability, reproducibility, testability, and regulatory defensibility. Also a
  strong answer to a judge asking "why did it choose that agent?"
- **Alternatives:** LLM-as-router — rejected: unexplainable, non-deterministic, unauditable.
- **Tradeoffs:** Weights need tuning; edge cases need explicit rules.
- **Future:** Learn the weights from outcome data — but keep the function linear and inspectable.

## D9. STT is re-implemented streaming-first; the reference project is reference only
- **Problem:** The team's earlier scam-detection STT works, but it's a batch file-in/file-out CLI:
  VAD the whole file → write chunks to disk → HF pipeline → CSV. ReadyCall needs text *while the
  customer is still talking*.
- **Decision:** New implementation behind an `SttEngine` port: rolling in-memory buffer, VAD
  **endpointing**, per-utterance transcription in a long-lived GPU-pinned worker, `TranscriptTurn`
  events. Same model family (`biodatlab/whisper-th-medium-combined`). The reference folder is read-only.
- **Reasoning:** Latency and privacy (no PII chunks on local disk) both demand it; the old shape can't
  be adapted into it.
- **Kept from the reference:** VAD parameters (threshold 0.65, min speech 500 ms, min silence 100 ms),
  the ~120 ms/60 ms segment padding, and a repetition guard for Whisper's silence-loop failure mode.
- **Changed:** `silero-vad` as a pip/ONNX dependency instead of a runtime `torch.hub.load` (a network
  fetch during a live call is unacceptable).
- **Future:** CTranslate2/`faster-whisper` conversion of the same checkpoint for latency, once verified.

## D10. Pre-call intake is a swappable STRATEGY, not inline orchestrator code
- **Problem:** v1 records and transcribes, but the intended evolution is a full AI voice agent that
  *talks* to the customer while they wait — and still hands the agent a transcript + summary.
- **Decision:** An `IntakeStrategy` protocol (`start` / `on_turn` / `finalize`) with
  `PassiveRecordIntake` (v1), `GuidedPromptIntake` (TTS slot-filling), and `ConversationalAgentIntake`
  (future). **All produce the same `IntakeResult` and emit the same events**, so nothing downstream
  knows or cares which ran. A `TtsEngine` port exists from day one even though v1 only needs
  pre-recorded prompts.
- **Reasoning:** The user explicitly wants this future open. Building the seam now costs one protocol;
  retrofitting it later costs a redesign of the orchestrator, the brief builder, and the agent screen.
- **Tradeoffs:** A small amount of indirection in v1 that isn't strictly needed yet.
- **Future:** The conversational strategy also needs turn-taking/barge-in, a tool layer with
  **read-only** access to the customer's own data, and much tighter guardrails — all inside the
  strategy, invisible to everything else.

## D11. No LLM framework (no LangChain / LlamaIndex / agent framework)
- **Problem:** The AI work here is a fixed, short pipeline: classify → extract → summarise → assemble.
- **Decision:** Plain Python + the provider SDK + versioned prompt files + Pydantic output schemas.
- **Reasoning:** Full control over what's recorded is what makes the brief traceable and the confidence
  number honest. Frameworks obscure exactly the steps we need to show a judge. (Same lesson as the
  user's other project: a hand-rolled traced pipeline beat a framework.)
- **Alternatives:** LangGraph — reconsider only if the *conversational* intake needs dynamic control flow.
- **Tradeoffs:** We write our own retry/timeout/tracing. Small and worth it.

## D12. The call is never blocked on AI
- **Problem:** Any AI stage can be slow, wrong, or down. A customer waiting longer *because of our AI*
  would invert the entire product thesis.
- **Decision:** Queue pop is driven solely by agent availability. Mid-flight intake is finalised as
  `partial`. Every stage has a timeout and a documented degradation rung (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §12).
- **Reasoning:** It's the product's core promise, and it's the honest engineering answer.
- **Tradeoffs:** More code paths; each needs a test.

## D13. Show a confidence number only when it's calibrated and above a floor
- **Problem:** The pitch shows "Intent Match: 96%". An uncalibrated number on an agent's screen is
  worse than none — a confidently wrong brief costs more time than a blank one.
- **Decision:** Confidence blends classifier posterior, agreement with the tapped plan, entity
  completeness and ASR quality, then is calibrated against the labelled scenario set. Below
  `CONFIDENCE_FLOOR` the UI shows "intent unclear — please confirm" and collapses to generic actions.
- **Reasoning:** Trust is the whole reason an agent looks at the panel at all.
- **Future:** Track agent 👍/👎 to re-calibrate continuously.

## D14. Consent-gated, PDPA-first, health data separately consented
- **Problem:** The brief makes PDPA an explicit constraint; health data is sensitive data requiring
  separate consent; cross-org (bank ↔ insurer) sharing needs a formal process.
- **Decision:** No consent → no intake, no analysis, context-only brief (and the call still works).
  Consent scopes are separate rows with basis + evidence. PII spans masked by default with audited
  reveal. Retention per artifact class + an erasure job across both stores and object storage.
- **Reasoning:** It's judged, it's law, and "we thought about PDPA" is a differentiator in this brief.
- **Tradeoffs:** Real work in P7 that doesn't demo visibly — so it gets *badges on the agent screen*
  to make it visible.

## D15. Redis Streams as the event backbone (Kafka behind the same port)
- **Problem:** Need ordered, replayable, at-least-once fan-out between orchestrator, transcription,
  analysis, routing and the agent socket — without operating Kafka during a hackathon.
- **Decision:** `EventBus` port; Redis Streams default (consumer groups + replay), `KafkaAdapter` for
  production scale, `InMemoryBus` for tests. Consumers are idempotent; replaying a call's stream must
  reproduce its final state.
- **Reasoning:** Redis is already needed for presence/queues/cache. Replayability is what lets the
  scenario runner drive the whole system without a telephone.
- **Tradeoffs:** Redis Streams is weaker on retention/partitioning than Kafka. Fine at this scale.

## D16. Coverage figures, eligibility and prices are DATA, never model output
- **Problem:** The highest-consequence hallucination in insurance is a wrong number about someone's
  cover. The brief also puts underwriting and pricing explicitly out of scope.
- **Decision:** The LLM may reference and phrase policy facts but never produce them. Numbers on the
  agent screen are rendered from `policies.coverage_json`; prompts receive them as given context and
  are instructed to cite, not compute. Closed taxonomies for intents, skills and next-best-actions.
- **Reasoning:** Product safety, regulatory scope, and judge credibility all point the same way.
- **Future:** Automated check in CI: any numeric in a generated brief must trace to a data field.

## D17. Documentation-as-memory (this docs/ folder + root CLAUDE.md)
- **Problem:** Multi-session AI-assisted work loses context; a five-person team loses it too.
- **Decision:** Adopt the structure proven in the user's `music-backlog-adder` project:
  `NEXT_SESSION` / `PROJECT_STATE` / `ARCHITECTURE` / `DECISIONS` / `BUG_HISTORY`, plus `PLAN`,
  `DATA_MODEL` and `INTEGRATIONS` for this project's extra surface area. One `CLAUDE.md` at the
  `krungsri/` root routes to whichever project is being worked on.
- **Tradeoffs:** `CLAUDE.md` lives outside both git repos (the root isn't a repo) — noted in the file.

## D18. Everything is demonstrable: timings, provenance, and rationale are persisted
- **Problem:** Judges score **Impact, Feasibility, Creativity, User insight**. Claims are cheap.
- **Decision:** Every stage writes its timing to `call_sessions.stage_timings_json`; every context
  field carries provenance; every routing decision carries its full score breakdown; every brief
  carries its sources and model/prompt version.
- **Reasoning:** It makes the demo *show* "context was ready in 1.2 s, before the phone rang" instead
  of asserting it — and it's genuinely how you'd debug this in production.
- **Tradeoffs:** More writes per call. Negligible, and it doubles as the metrics substrate.
