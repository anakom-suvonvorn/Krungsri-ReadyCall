"""The runtime model switch, and the false report it was built to fix (`D138`, `B41`).

Two things are proved here, and the first is a bug that had been true on the dev laptop for
days:

* **`B41` — a machine can be calling a hosted model while every screen says it is not.**
  `build_fast_llm` builds a REAL client whenever `LLM_FAST_MODEL` is set, whatever
  `LLM_PROVIDER` says, and the preview summary, the customer-context panel and the
  comparison's reason sentence all run on `fast_llm or llm`. The test-call dialog computed
  *"is the AI on?"* from `LLM_PROVIDER` alone and reported **"no model configured — calls
  no model"** on exactly that setup.
* **`D138` — the provider can be changed without a restart**, so a pitch can show the same
  call with and without the model. Rebuilt through `build_llm`, never persisted, and the
  request names a provider and nothing else.

Nothing here calls a model: the switch is asserted on which client got built, and
`rulebased` is a real adapter that needs no key.
